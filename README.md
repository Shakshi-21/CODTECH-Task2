## Overview of the Project

### Project: Hospital Management System using Java Programming

### Objective
The objective is to develop a Java-based healthcare management system that automates patient registration, appointment scheduling, EHR, billing, inventory, and staff management for improved operational efficiency.

### Key Activities
* Patient Registration: The system captures patient details like personal information, medical history, and contact information, and stores them.\
* Appointment Scheduling: Patients can schedule, modify, or cancel appointments based on doctors' availability through an intuitive interface.\
* Billing and Invoicing: The system generates invoices for medical services provided, handles payment processing, and maintains billing records for review.\

### Technologies Used
**1. Java (JDK 22.0.2):** The primary programming language.\
**2. Java Collections Framework:** Utilized to manage data structures such as ArrayList for storing multiple patient accounts.\
**3. Notepad:** Used as a simple text editor to write and edit the Java code.\
**4. Command Prompt(cmd):** Used to compile and run the Java program, providing an interface to execute Java commands and interact with the application.
