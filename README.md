### Project: Hospital Management System using Java Programming

### Objective
The objective is to develop a Java-based healthcare management system that automates patient registration, appointment scheduling, EHR, billing, inventory, and staff management for improved operational efficiency.

### Key Activities
**1. Patient Registration:** The system captures patient details like personal information, medical history, and contact information, and stores them.\
**2. Appointment Scheduling:** Patients can schedule, modify, or cancel appointments based on doctors' availability through an intuitive interface.\
**3. Billing and Invoicing:** The system generates invoices for medical services provided, handles payment processing, and maintains billing records for review.

### Technologies Used
**1. Java (JDK 22.0.2):** The primary programming language.\
**2. Java Collections Framework:** Utilized to manage data structures such as ArrayList for storing multiple patient accounts.\
**3. Notepad:** Used as a simple text editor to write and edit the Java code.\
**4. Command Prompt(cmd):** Used to compile and run the Java program, providing an interface to execute Java commands and interact with the application.

### Key Insights
**1. Comprehensive Patient Management:** Uses dedicated classes to handle detailed patient registration, medical history, and personal information efficiently.\
**2. Organized Appointment Scheduling:** Implements appointment scheduling through a structured class for managing bookings and doctor-patient interactions.\
**3. Efficient Billing and Invoicing:** Manages billing processes with a dedicated class for generating and tracking patient invoices and payments.\
**4. Robust Inventory and Staff Management:** Utilizes classes to manage medical inventory and staff information, ensuring accurate tracking and updates.

### Conclusion
The hospital management system leverages Javaâ€™s object-oriented design and data management capabilities to create a comprehensive solution for healthcare facilities. It includes robust modules for patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical record management, billing, inventory, and staff administration.
